# CS-320-SoftwareTesting

### 1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
   Writing unit tests that verify that the functions/objects work according to the requirements and
   by testing edge cases to verify limits. 
### 2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
   Take the time to read and understand all the requirements and create tests that
   that verify those requirements.
### 3. How do I approach designing software?
   I approach projects by breaking them down into smaller and easier to work
   with parts. I also try to be consistent because it makes my work easier to come
   back to and quickly understand.
